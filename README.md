# Penrose

This project was created for a board exchange project organised among members
of the [Boldport Club](https://boldport.club/) in 2019. It has nothing to do
with Boldport, other than being inspired by their work!

# PREVIEW

Until I add the full board project and code, there are some rough instructions
and binary images on the [preview branch](https://github.com/threebytesfull/penrose/tree/preview)
